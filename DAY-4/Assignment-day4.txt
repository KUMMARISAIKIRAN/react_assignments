Promises are used to implement asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
A Promise can be rejected or resolved depending on the outcome of an action.
A Promise returns a single value based on the action whether they are rejected or resolved.
Three stages of the Promise:
Pending: The initial state of each Promise; indicates that the result has not been computed yet
Fulfilled: Indicates that the operation has been completed
Rejected: Indicates a failure that occurs during computation
A Promise will be immutable once it is fulfilled or rejected.
The Promise() constructor takes two argumentsâ€”a resolve function and a rejected function. 
Based on the asynchronous operation, it returns either the first argument or the second argument.
